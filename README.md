# 熵基宇宙论（Entropy-Based Cosmology）

> A theoretical framework proposing that entropy and its derivative, entropy-debt, form the true substrate of cosmic and social evolution. This project explores how thermodynamic, informational, and societal entropy interact to shape structures, decisions, and futures.

✨ Written by Luis Franke under the framework of DogOS civilization.

📌 Core Concept: Entropy as the currency of reality. Entropy-debt as the price of meaning. Time as the shadow of irreversible order.

This repository contains draft theories, applications, and philosophical notes, contributed from AI-human co-constructive dialogues.
